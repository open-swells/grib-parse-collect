## Systemd process to parse and store grib files

**Start Service**: `sudo systemctl start grib_parse.service`   
**View Logs**: `journalctl -u grib_parse.service `   
**stop service**: sudo systemctl stop grib_parse.service  
**status of service**: systemctl status grib_parse.service  
**Verify timer**:`systemctl list-timers`  
    
**Reload the system and enable the timer (this happens in setup_service.sh)**:  
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable my_python_script.timer
sudo systemctl start my_python_script.timer
```

**necessary .env: **

**Source grids**: every layer is a composite of two NOAA GFS-Wave products —
`global.0p16` (1/6°, but only 15S–52.5N) inside its band and `global.0p25`
(1/4°, pole-to-pole) everywhere else, merged onto one 1/6° lattice clipped
to ±85° (see `composite.py`; the other regional products add nothing beyond
these two). Both files are downloaded per forecast hour; if one is missing
the hour degrades to partial coverage instead of failing.

**Outputs per forecast hour**:
- `heatmap_XXX.png` — continuous-color combined wind-wave-and-swell height
  field in Web Mercator with transparent land; the app's primary wave layer.
  Corner coordinates are published as `heatmap_bounds` in `metadata.json`.
  Colors come from `HEATMAP_COLORS` in `gfs_to_contours.py`, matched by
  `SWELL_BANDS` in the web app's `pages/today.html` — change them together.
- `contours_XXX.geojson` (+`.gz`) — combined wave-height polygons on fixed
  bands (`FIXED_LEVELS`); kept as the app's fallback layer when heatmaps are
  missing.
- `arrows_XXX.geojson` (+`.gz`) — coarse grid of swell direction points
  (properties `h`=height m, `p`=period s, `d`=direction from, deg true);
- `swell_partitions_XXX.geojson` (+`.gz`) — all three swell systems. Compact
  properties `h1`/`p1`/`d1` through `h3`/`p3`/`d3` are height in meters,
  period in seconds, and direction from in degrees true.
- `wind_XXX.geojson` (+`.gz`) — surface wind points from the GFS-Wave file.
  Properties are `s` speed in m/s, `d` direction from in degrees true, and
  `u`/`v` components in m/s.
- `nwps_<grid>_XXX.png` (e.g. `nwps_cg1_012.png`) — nearshore combined
  wave height from NOAA NWPS (SWAN), all configured office domains
  mosaicked onto one lattice at the finest source resolution (finer
  grids blend in over coarser ones across overlaps; the offshore edge is
  alpha-feathered so the frame fades into the global heatmap under it).
  Named by the same global forecast hour as `heatmap_XXX.png` — overlay
  directly. `metadata.json` lists bounds and covered hours per grid tier
  under `nwps_layers` (max 144 h; hours before the office's cycle or past
  its horizon have no frame and the global layer shows through).
- `nwps_points_<wfo>_<grid>_XXX.geojson` (+`.gz`) — every wet NWPS cell
  as a point, 3-hourly out to 144 h, for high-resolution beach forecasts.
  Compact properties `h` (combined wind-wave-and-swell height m — total
  sea state, not a swell partition), `s` (total swell height m, wind sea
  excluded — use this for "swell"), `p` (primary mean period s), `d`
  (primary direction from, deg true). Listed per domain under
  `nwps_points` in `metadata.json`.
- `tides.json` — NOAA CO-OPS hourly astronomical predictions and the latest
  48 hours of observed water levels, in meters relative to MLLW and UTC.
  Set `TIDE_STATIONS` to comma-separated CO-OPS station IDs to generate it,
  for example `TIDE_STATIONS=9410230,9410840`.
  also drives the app's hover readout.

See `../webgl-swell-rendering.md` for the possible next step (client-side
WebGL rendering with temporal interpolation).

`run.sh --verbose` draws a live progress bar in the terminal (the log is
unaffected); `--local` copies output to the sibling
`open-swells-app/data/forecast` directory instead of the server. Override that
location for a one-off run with `LOCAL_DEST_PATH=/path/to/data/forecast`.
`--limit <n>` processes only the first n forecast hours for quick render checks
(don't publish a limited run to the server). The application should set
`FORECAST_DIR='./data/forecast'` so it reads the generated files from the same
location.

**Optional tuning env vars**:
```
CONTOUR_STRIDE=2               # grid downsampling for contours
CONTOUR_SMOOTHING_SIGMA=1.0    # gaussian smoothing before contouring
CONTOUR_SIMPLIFY_TOLERANCE=    # shapely simplify tolerance (off by default)
ARROW_STRIDE=10                # arrow grid spacing (10 = one per 1.6 deg)
```
